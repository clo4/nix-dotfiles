# In order to keep ZSH as the login shell but still use
# Fish interactively, this snippet will execute Fish if
# none of the parent processes were Fish. Unless I run into
# some serious issues, I've consolidated on all shells
# launching ZSH, which does some amount of generic init,
# then puts me into Fish if the session is interactive.
#
# zshenv is the first file that ZSH executes, but a standalone
# Home Manager installation adds the Nix setup to zshrc,
# so the necessary setup would be skipped in that system.
# Everything that zshenv does can also be done in zshrc,
# unless it has to be done unconditionally for non-interactive
# shells - in which case that's also the best spot for it,
# since the spawned and exec'd fish shell will inherit
# the variables.
#
# NOTE: this doesn't handle `nix shell` at all because
# it's difficult to determine if the current shell was
# directly invoked by it. Instead, I use a wrapper function
# in Fish that appends `--command $(status fish-path)`.
